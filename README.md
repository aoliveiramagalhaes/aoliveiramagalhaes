# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aline

![Banner](./AlineMagalhaes.png)


:muscle: I'm a **hands-on, self-driven professional** with extensive experience developing products that scale, leading cross-functional teams to plan, develop, launch and manage top-performing products. 

ðŸŒ± In 2020, I decided to learn how to code because I wanted an immersion in all tech fronts.

I decided to build my portfolio to practice what I learn in bootcamps and webinars, and I'm very proud of my work!

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my portfolio.

**Skills:** REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
