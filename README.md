![Banner](./AlineMagalhaes.png)


:muscle: I'm a **hard-working, innovative, cross-Functional** professional with extensive experience in Product and Project Management that decided to make the most out of 2020 and is learning to code as a side project.

ðŸŒ± Last year, I decided to make a switch to Product Management in tech. I have done a lot of courses, from coding, product, and UX. I'm focusing on Product Management, but I wanted an immersion in all tech fronts. I recently became a **Certified Scrum Product Owner** :trophy:

I decided to build my portfolio to practice what I learn in bootcamps and webinars, and I'm very proud of my work!

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my portfolio.

**Skills:** REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
