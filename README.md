# Hi there 👋 I'm Aline

![Banner](./AlineMagalhaes.png)


**Visionary, Innovative, Cross-Functional** professional with extensive experience in product and project management, leading cross-functional teams to plan, build, launch and manage top-performing solutions, with Agile/Scrum experience, marketing orientation, and analytical abilities to evolve product strategy that maximizes organization growth.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development at Codecademy to deliver a full-scope approach to front-end development (I am loving it 😍). I'm very detail-oriented and problem-solver; skills which I acquired after working in Quality Assurance for so many years.

I'm excited about software development, mostly because of its ability to deliver products and value right from my laptop.

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my portolio.

**Skills:** REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
